<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The Danish Girl</h3>
<p>Eddie Redmayne nailed the role. It was very emotional and touching.</p>
<h3>Shutter Island</h3>
<p>Any movie directed by Scorsese is sure to be a treat, and DiCaprio's acting was impeccable as usual.The storyline in itself was just unpredictable and had a major twist at the end, left me feeling disoriented for a few days after. </p>
<h3>Forest Gump</h3>
<p>This was a vey touching movie and is close to my heart as i had watched it during a time when i wasn't mentally stable and it provided me comfort.</p>
